# This is a reusable GitHub Action workflow for testing a package PR on buildout.coredev.
# For now (May 2022) it is an experiment, but I (Maurits) think we need it.
# Reasons:
# 1. The robot tests on Jenkins are flaky/unstable, which most likely is due
#    to several robot jobs running parallel on one node.
# 2. Python 3.10 is not working with the 'Python Shining Pandas' plugin we use
#    on Jenkins.  We had it running with a different script for a while, but
#    these changes got lost.  Should be restorable, but let's try GHA.
#
# One thing to watch out for, is that robot tests are not always reported as failures.
# On the one hand there is config for that on Jenkins:
# https://github.com/plone/jenkins.plone.org/issues/297
# On the other hand I see the same problem locally:
# https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/3537

# The first user of this reusable workflow is:
# https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/pull/3540
# See there for the few lines you need.
